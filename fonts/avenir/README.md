# Avenir Font Files

Place the following Avenir font files in this directory:

1. `Avenir-Regular.woff2` and `Avenir-Regular.woff` (Regular weight)
2. `Avenir-Medium.woff2` and `Avenir-Medium.woff` (Medium weight)
3. `Avenir-Bold.woff2` and `Avenir-Bold.woff` (Bold weight)

Avenir is a premium font that needs to be purchased. If you don't have access to the Avenir font files, you can use a similar alternative like Nunito or Montserrat, which are available for free on Google Fonts.

If you have the font files in different formats (like .ttf or .otf), you may need to convert them to .woff and .woff2 formats for better web compatibility. You can use online font converters for this purpose.
